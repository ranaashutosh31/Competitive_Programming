PROBLEM LINK IN EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
Given a singly linked list with N nodes and a number X. The task is to find the node at the given index (X)(1 based index) of linked list. 

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains space seperated two integers, length of linked list and X.

Output:
For each testcase, there will be single line of output containing data at Xth node.

Example:
Input:
2
6 5
1 2 3 4 657 76
10 2
